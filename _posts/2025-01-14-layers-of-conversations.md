This theme has been in my head for a couple of years now. We used to call it the "indoctrination problem" that we have (you can see my flair for terms with overloaded meanings). Here's a description of the problem: 

"People live to find meaning and purpose, and if their workplace gives them these things, it's a worthy workplace. But how does a workplace communicate meaning and purpose?"

Most organisations stop at the term "communicate". This is what leads to meaning and purpose being atop vision/mission slides that get presented in onboarding. The org speaks in a one-to-many tone, and expects the worthy to listen and associate with its purpose. 

But that is not how someone finds meaning and purpose. 

Finding a meaning and purpose is about subscribing to a new idea. Onboarding slides are like flashing an Instagram ad story, and hoping that people will find resonance. No. Finding resonance with an idea is a repeated activity. There are false starts, a lot of moments of flops. A better way to think of someone subscribing to an idea is to think of a kid learning to skate for the first time. The false starts are many, before someone finds resonance.
