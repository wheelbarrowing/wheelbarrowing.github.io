title:  "meaning and purpose at work; talkative leaders"

This theme has been in my head for a couple of years now. We used to call it the "indoctrination problem" that we have (you can see my flair for terms with overloaded meanings). Here's a description of the problem: 

"People live to find meaning and purpose, and if their workplace gives them these things, it's a worthy workplace. But how does a workplace communicate meaning and purpose?"

Most organisations stop at the term "communicate". This is what leads to meaning and purpose being atop vision/mission slides that get presented in onboarding. The org speaks in a one-to-many tone, and expects the worthy to listen and associate with its purpose. 

But that is not how someone finds meaning and purpose. 

Finding a meaning and purpose is about subscribing to a new idea. Onboarding slides are like flashing an Instagram ad in a story, and hoping that people will find resonance. No. Finding resonance with an idea is a repeated activity. There are false starts, a lot of moments of flops. A better way to think of someone subscribing to an idea is to think of a kid learning to skate for the first time. The false starts are many, before someone finds resonance. 

How do you achieve resonance? Some things I've learned: 
- Source intuition: In building our purpose statements, we take terms of English, and combine them or overload them in ways that gives them new meaning. For instance - Jobs said he'll go to "thermonuclear war" with Google over Android. He didn't mean it literally, but in introducing this to conversation, he added a new degree of intensity. If I'm talking about a new term (say, "Healthy"), I need to go understand what my teammate's intuition of Healthy is

- Bridging intuition: Once I understand someone's starting intuition, the next task is to build a bridge between what they percieve Healthy to mean, and what I perceive Healthy to mean. Instead of asking people to expand on healthy right off the bat, it helps to warm them up with multiple choice questions - "do you feel samosa is healthy?" "No". "Do you feel quinoa is healthy?" "Yes". It is important to think of this stage as a "feel" development stage, rather than a reasoning development stage. 

- Tying definitions together: In the bridging exercise, individuals, and groups of people (it's fun to do this in a small group of 2-10 people as people relax and play off each other's cues) will bring out contradictions and realise quickly that there are many ways to define "healthy" (some think ghee is healthy, others think ghee is unhealthy). It is now important to start summarising this into a larger whole, and going into an underlying commonality of definition, and acceptance of contradictions. 

- Repeat: While bridging and tying are great social exercises, they also tend to be forgotten. These, when done across an org, need spaced repetitions. Every person needs to be in atleast three major conversations (and I'd think atleast two minor targeted conversations), over a four week period, for these definitions to sink in.

- Testing: The real test for definitions is to go back to Sourcing intuition. This can't be a stated test, but a dipstick measurement - has their intuition on "healthy" changed and aligned with yours/the organisation's? If not, there might be some targeted activities to involve them with (arranging for customer conversations, working through reading material). 

==============

As a young engineer (and even as a founder) I'd often scoff at meetings, and this act of talking that all senior management seemed to be involved with. I now understand what the goal is. If your team isn't aligned to a common goal, you have failed as a leader.
