One mode of failure for employees at an early stage startup is a lack of energy. Early stage startups are ambitious, partly-formed hypotheses. The founders have likely found some version of truth, and some validation, as there are some early customers who have signed up. However, the processes of founders are messy, and inefficient. There are so many obvious opportunities and landmines that get missed. 

The goal of early employees is to build to these hollow foundations. But that's also a path to burnout and disllusionment. Either an early employee does not realise that they're building on hollow foundations (and risk later life sunk cost disillusionment) or they do, but are unable to move jobs (because of internal doubt, life conditions, or market conditions). 

There is a much better success pathway though. An early employee who isn't crippled by self-doubt, or inertia, will rise up and point out what's wrong. An even better success pathway is someone pointing it out, aligning, and improving. Often, the path to improvement involves building your own intuition about the users and the market. This is a hard and thankless job. You have to be ambitious or stubborn in some degree to do this - either there's the older person ambition of "I'll likely start my own business", which is where doing something like this makes sense. Or there is the younger person rebellion of "I don't know what I want to do in life, but this is shit! I will do this better" (the rebellion pattern can also exist in an older person). 

Holding this much ambition and following up with it needs some energy. You're fighting two forces - the market, and the founders. The reason to do it though - you get to tear something down and build it up as your own on someone else's dime. And the founders, if they're half-okay, will not stand between you and the market. 

If, however, this doesn't feel like your cup of tea, on the other side awaits terminal burnout and disillusionment. 

p.s. This feeling of rebellion and ambition also needs to be nurtured. I suspect in far many more cases and orgs, the rebellion is killed and you're asked to fall in line. And the ambitious find their way out by using the company as a catapult upwards. 

p.p.s. This feeling of rebellion atleast can also be encouraged. Most people who join early stage startups after a few years of working elsewhere, are likely to have tempered their feelings of rebellion. These people will open up again and be assertive. However, they are unlikely to be cultural leaders of the kind you look for inside your org, atleast not early in their tenure.
