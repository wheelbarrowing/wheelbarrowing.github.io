Last week, a community member went ballistic at us. On digging a little deeper,we found that this member had been attempting to reach out to us for five days. They had an issue, which we thought wasn't an issue. They kept insisting it was an issue. We kept on using reasonable arguments and politeness in insisting it wasn't an issue. We were convinced it wasn't an issue. Somehow, five days in, we are being shouted at.

How do two reasonable sides resort to a shouting match? 

It turns out, that we weren't able to listen. Not to what they were saying out loud in words, but we weren't listening to their tone. Or their frequency of conversation with us. Or realising that they'd called us many times, and gone to a different person each time. Or that they'd had many service tickets in their name. This person was trying to have a coherent conversation with us. And our systems kept stripping the conversation into tickets, screenshots, texts, phone calls, across English and Hindi, terminologies as "logs", "carbs", "stainless steel works this way".  

Humans attempt to have conversations with other humans. These are difficult in themselves, because listening is hard. Humans, also attempt to have conversations with systems. And systems are a hundred times worse at listening. Whether it is a human "raising a ticket", or a human "talking to a company", or a human "protesting against government". Systems see humans as tickets, resources, populations, voters, listeners, subscribers, and strip them of their humanity. A human in representation is always less than a human. 

So what do you do? I suspect one way to think about this, is to give a representation atleast two or more diverse dimensions. A subscriber is also a part time teacher who takes Math tuitions for kids in their building. Or a voter is also a front-row listener whenever a qawwali happens at Jashn-e-Rekhta. Or a resource, is also your team's fastest bowler in the inter-department tournament. One of these dimensions has to be quite local, if the other is global. The split could be in deciding dimensions by orders of magnitude. If there are 6-7 orders of magnitude in voters (a million voters) in Bengaluru, the other dimension has to be no more than 2 (100 and under). 

Breaking out a human into a second dimension often opens up a new way of looking at them in clusters. Still thinking about how this will happen at scale.
