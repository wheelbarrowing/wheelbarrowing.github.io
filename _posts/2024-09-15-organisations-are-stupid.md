At the end of my first two months of life after college, I was filled with dread. The workplace felt one-dimensional. I felt like I didn't understand the dynamics. I could feel that many different kinds of human games were underway, but didn't know how to enter these games. Worse, I didn't know which games were worth playing. Even worse, deciding on the worth of these games was problematic, because I didn't know what I was optimising for. 

I then went to work for a smaller satellite to a larger organisation. Here, I could start seeing some of the games in action. One new and alien game I call  "empire building". The protagonist maximises the number of people in their reporting structure. Like building an empire. Another one I call "prestige levering". Here, the protagonist collects high-prestige relationships or projects and ups their social status in the organisation. Prestige came from working with a leader high in the hierarchy, or being sent to another country. 

Later, I went to work at an empire of an organisation with a single king at the center. I did everything to impress the king. I played the game. 

Now, I run my own organisation. I worry about the smartest people in my organisation having to play these games. To them, I want to say this - 

Organisations are inherently stupid. Groups of people are inherently stupid. Imagine going to a random party on a Friday night in a big city. It is almost certain that these groups will be engaged in complaint marathons. If groups of people who somewhat like each other's company are devolving to complaint, imagine what happens to groups of people who are only held together by being hired by the same people. 

Organisations tend to devolve to organisational games of empire or prestige, and make stupid decisions.  

To do good work, organisations can either aspire to be less stupid, or be more like religions (or channelise games of empire or prestige, but that is something your competition is already doing better than you). In familiar terms - Atheistic, or cult-like. Cults are going to do great work in the collective, and individuals will do anything for the cult. Atheists are going to do great work in the individual, and risk being worse in the collective. Most of us don't have messiah personalities. So the only option we have is to build atheistic organisations.  

To build atheistic organisations, you find smart people, and let them be smart by de-emphasising games of prestige, empire and hierarchy.
