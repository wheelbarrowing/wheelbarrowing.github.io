Pessimism in Startups
2024-11-05

Startups need to operate on optimism. startups are founded and run on a basic premise that the world needs something that it does not have. If the world alrrady has it, a startup dies (or evolves). 

Most insights are hard to come by. The easier ones are likely already monetised or monopolised, and a part of our narrative. So what happens in the pursuit up to finding out this insight? A lot of heartburn. 

 By nature, I am a pessimist in the details, and sometimes that pessimism rises up to the level of vision too. Sometimes it rises up on its own. At other times, another life event would suddenly make me look away from the narrow path of possibility, to everything else that is around. Like a biker on a road cutting through a desert. 

I think this rubs off on to the rest of the organisation as well. Should one be a robot of optimism and energy at all times? That is atleast what stories about Bhavish would have uou believe. I would like to think that that kind of a thing is existential critical for a n organisation that runs on operations as its life blood. For organisations like ours that run on sales/product duality, I feel like this energy is only a part of our existence. That it is probably okay to come to work for a week feeling pessimistic. That consistency of execution to an insight over a period still matters, but the day to day can be a little more hot and cold
